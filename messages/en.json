    "conceptDescription": "Inspired by the traditional concept of ampoules—a small vessel preserving what remains of a life. What was the decisive moment in their story?

      "icare": "To escape from Crete, he flew with artificial wings. A beautiful impulse—the fierce wind and the warmth of the sun, filled him with ecstasy. He flew too close; the feathers and dripping wax fell with his life.",
      "cassandre": "Born as the princess of Troy, she came into this world bearing both her gift and her curse. She foresaw the fall of Troy, yet Apollo's punishment made her unable to convince others of the coming tragedy.",
      "narcisse": "His destiny was foretold at birth: he would lose his life to an unfulfillable love—his own reflection, a beautiful illusion. Only the fragrance of narcissus remains by the lakeside.",
      "antigone": "Born into a house stained with curses, she watched her brothers slay each other. She held fast to what she believed was right, and buried the fallen with her own hands—even at the cost of her own life."
